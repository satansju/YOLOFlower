<h1> YOLOFlower: An adaptation of YOLOv5 for sliced inference/training with Sahi and tracking with ByteTrack </h1>
<h2> Training </h2>
Examples of training and hyperparameter tuning can be found in the "ExperimentX.py" scripts.

<h2> Inference with tracking </h2>
The YOLOFlower model (only trained for <i> Silene acaulis</i> cushion timelapse tracking at 60 cm directly above the cushion!) is ready to use as is using the "track.py" script.
